Exercise 08 - practicepython.org

Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. 
(Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, 
print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)

Remember the rules: Rock beats scissors, Scissors beats paper, Paper beats rock
